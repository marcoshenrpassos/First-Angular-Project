# First-Angular-Project

This course seemed to be quick and easy, but as it was released in 2018, there have happened so many changes in the tools that I has to spend a lot of time just fixing those. Also, the PrimeNG integration was quite problematic due to the incompatibility of the new version of both Angular and PrimaNG itself, apparently with no solution currently. Apart from this, the integrations with APIs and a java server to add and delete data went well. The course is really good at covering most of Angular's aspects: Componets, modules, routing, services, lazy load, etc.
